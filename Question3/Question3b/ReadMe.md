## Minimum Spanning Tree Implementation

The GraphStructure class represents a graph and provides a method findMinimumSpanningTreeUsingHeap() to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph using a minimum heap. The UnionFinder class is used internally to perform union-find operations efficiently.

## Priority Queue Implementation

The PriorityQueueImplementation class implements a priority queue using a minimum heap. It utilizes the MinHeap class to maintain the heap property.
